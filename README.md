Multiclass filter algorithm - orthogonal filter for ordinal classification

Here, I am constructing a novel OPC multiclass filter for ordinal classification problems. 

The manuscript will be published in advance as an aXriv preprint in Machine Learning / IEEE TechRxiv preprint, with theoretical exposition, filter algorithm design and data validation.
